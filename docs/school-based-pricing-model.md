# School-Based EduBotics Pricing Model

## üéØ Overview

Instead of individual student subscriptions, schools purchase account packages and manage student access directly. This approach provides better cost control, administrative oversight, and educational integration.

## üí∞ Pricing Structure

### **Recommended Model: School Package Plans**

| Plan | Students | Monthly Training Credits | Price/Month | Price/Year | Features |
|------|----------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Starter School** | 5 students | 25 trainings | ‚Ç¨99 | ‚Ç¨999 (2 months free) | Basic teacher dashboard |
| **Standard School** | 10 students | 50 trainings | ‚Ç¨179 | ‚Ç¨1,790 (1 month free) | Full teacher dashboard, reports |
| **Premium School** | 20 students | 100 trainings | ‚Ç¨299 | ‚Ç¨2,990 (1 month free) | Priority support, custom curriculum |
| **Enterprise School** | Unlimited | 200+ trainings | ‚Ç¨499 | ‚Ç¨4,990 | Dedicated support, API access |

### **Benefits of School-Based Model:**

   - View individual student progress and engagement
   - Generate reports for educational assessment

4. **Billing and Administration**
   - Single monthly/yearly invoice per school
   - Usage reports included in billing
   - Easy to add/remove student accounts

## üìà Revenue Projections

### **Conservative Estimates (50 schools in Year 1):**
- Average plan: Standard (‚Ç¨179/month)
- Annual revenue: 50 √ó ‚Ç¨179 √ó 12 = ‚Ç¨107,400
- Much higher than individual model: 50 √ó 10 √ó ‚Ç¨9.90 √ó 12 = ‚Ç¨59,400

### **Growth Projections:**
- Year 1: 50 schools = ‚Ç¨107k ARR
